# titanic-ai

This is my interpretation of the Titanic competition of Kaggle.
It uses a neural network build with Keras that contains an input layer with 12 nodes, two hidden layer with 16 neurons each and a sigmoid as an output layer.

The code to preprocess the dataset was copied from https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/jeffs_helpful.ipynb
